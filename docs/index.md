**Impact:** 

We demonstrate where, how, and why conifer seedlings are present/not present in a post-wildfire landscape in Colorado Front Range using spatial modeling framework producing actionable visuals, a concise briefs, and shareable codes.

## Project summary

### Our product 
This repository provides a bayasian spatial modeling framework implemneted using rINLA to predict the seedling establisghmnet potential with uncertainty in a postfire environment penalize with site , fire, and climate pecific characteristics.

### Our question(s) 
<!-- EDIT: Replace bullets with your own. Encourage divergent takes. -->
- Why here or what drives the distribution of conifer seedlings/ and with time (emergence)?
- What is the impact of legecy (dead trees) and other woody vegetation on seedling survival?

### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
<!-- EDIT: Plain language, short and honest. -->
- We think that seed avilability defines the seedling establisghment regardless fire specific characteristics
- We think thta shade tents or proximity to shrubs/standing dead reduce VPD and raise survival in largely open landscapes.
  

### Why this matters 
<!-- EDIT: 2–3 sentences max, decision-oriented. -->
In the western US and most of the global dry forest landscapes postfire recovery is studied in local scales and are studying site specific questions. We believe that with current high frequency, high intensity wildfires in the dry forest systems, there need a standard way of understanding how these postfire landscapes evolves and how intentional managemnet needed to be supplied. To make these descitions, it is importamt to know the mechanisms on postfire seedling establishments and the drievers impacting. This study provides a Bayasian spatial modeling framework to inform uncertainty driven insights for seedling establishments usings an array of wildires occured in over two decades ago in the Southern Rockies Ponderosa pine forests.

### Findings at a glance 📣
<!-- EDIT: 2–4 bullets, each a headline in plain language with a number if possible. -->
- Headline 1 — what, where, how much
- Headline 2 — change/trend/contrast
- Headline 3 — implication for practice or policy

### Visuals that tell the story 📣
<!-- EDIT: Swap visuals; prioritize clarity. -->
