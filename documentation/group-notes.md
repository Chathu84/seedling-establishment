# Group Notes

Use this shared notebook to capture meeting highlights, decisions, and follow-up tasks.

- Summarize key takeaways after each working session.
- Note data sources, analysis ideas, and open questions.
- Assign owners and due dates for action items so nothing slips through the cracks.
- Drop helpful links, screenshots, or file references so the team can find them later.

Feel free to add new sections as needed to keep everyone aligned and informed.
